# Installation

Installation is made of three steps:

* Download the `kubeless` CLI from the [release page](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases). (OSX users can also use [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install kubeless`).
* Create a `kubeless` namespace (used by default)
* Then use one of the YAML manifests found in the release page to deploy kubeless. It will create a _functions_ Custom Resource Definition and launch a controller.

There are several kubeless manifests being shipped for multiple k8s environments (non-rbac, rbac and openshift), pick the one that corresponds to your environment:

* `kubeless-$RELEASE.yaml` is used for RBAC Kubernetes cluster.
* `kubeless-non-rbac-$RELEASE.yaml` is used for non-RBAC Kubernetes cluster.
* `kubeless-openshift-$RELEASE.yaml` is used to deploy Kubeless to OpenShift (1.5+).

For example, this below is a show case of deploying kubeless to a non-RBAC Kubernetes cluster.

```console
$ export RELEASE=v1.0.0-alpha.1
$ kubectl create ns kubeless
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/download/$RELEASE/kubeless-non-rbac-$RELEASE.yaml

$ kubectl get pods -n kubeless
NAME                                           READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubeless-controller-manager-567dcb6c48-ssx8x   1/1       Running   0          1h

$ kubectl get deployment -n kubeless
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
kubeless-controller-manager   1         1         1            1           1h

$ kubectl get customresourcedefinition
NAME                          AGE
cronjobtriggers.kubeless.io   1h
functions.kubeless.io         1h
httptriggers.kubeless.io      1h

$ kubectl get functions
NAME         AGE
get-python   1d
```

> Details on [installing kubeless in a different namespace](/docs/function-controller-configuration) can be found here.  

You are now ready to create functions.

# Usage

You can use the CLI to create a function. Functions have three possible types:

* http triggered (function will expose an HTTP endpoint)
* pubsub triggered (function will consume event on a specific topic; a running kafka cluster on your k8s is required)
* schedule triggered (function will be called on a cron schedule)

## HTTP function

Here is a toy:

```python
def foobar(event, context):
  print event
  return event['data']
```

Functions in Kubeless have the same format regardless of the language of the function or the event source. In general, every function:

 - Receives an object `event` as their first parameter. This parameter includes all the information regarding the event source. In particular, the key 'data' should contain the body of the function request.
 - Receives a second object `context` with general information about the function.
 - Returns a string/object that will be used as response for the caller.

You can find more details about the function interface [here](/docs/runtimes#runtimes-interface)

You create it with:

```console
$ kubeless function deploy get-python --runtime python2.7 \
                                --from-file test.py \
                                --handler test.foobar
INFO[0000] Deploying function...
INFO[0000] Function get-python submitted for deployment
INFO[0000] Check the deployment status executing 'kubeless function ls get-python'
```

Let's dissect the command:

* `get-python`: This is the name of the function we want to deploy.
* `--runtime python2.7`: This is the runtime we want to use to run our function. Available runtimes are shown in the help information.
* `--from-file test.py`: This is the file containing the function code. It is supported to specify a zip file as far as it doesn't exceed the maximum size for an etcd entry (1 MB).
* `--handler test.foobar`: This specifies the file and the exposed function that will be used when receiving requests. In this example we are using the function `foobar` from the file `test.py`.
* `--env` to pass env vars to the function like `--env foo=bar,bar=foo`. See the [detail](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/pull/316#issuecomment-332172876)

Other available options are:

* `--trigger-topic` to trigger the function with a certain Kafka topic. See the [next example](#pubsub-function).
* `--timeout` to specify the timeout (in seconds) for the function to complete its execution (default "180")
* `--schedule` to trigger the function following a certain schedule using Cron notation. F.e. `--schedule "*/10 * * * *"` would trigger the function every 10 minutes.
* `--secrets`: This sets a list of Secrets to be mounted as Volumes to the functions pod. They will be available in the path `/<secret_name>`.

You can find the rest of options available when deploying a function executing `kubeless function deploy --help`

You will see the function custom resource created:

```console
$ kubectl get functions
NAME         AGE
get-python   1h

$ kubeless function ls
NAME           	NAMESPACE	HANDLER       RUNTIME  	TYPE  	TOPIC      	DEPENDENCIES	STATUS
get-python     	default  	helloget.foo  python2.7	HTTP  	           	            	1/1 READY
```

You can then call the function with:

```console
$ kubeless function call get-python --data '{"echo": "echo echo"}'
{"echo": "echo echo"}
```

Or you can curl directly with `kubectl proxy`
using an [apiserver proxy
URL](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/access-cluster/#manually-constructing-apiserver-proxy-urls).
For example:

```console
$ kubectl proxy -p 8080 &

$ curl -L --data '{"Another": "Echo"}' \
  --header "Content-Type:application/json" \
  localhost:8080/api/v1/proxy/namespaces/default/services/get-python:http-function-port/
{"Another": "Echo"}
```

Kubeless also supports [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) which means you can provide your custom URL to the function. Please refer to [this doc](/docs/routing) for more details.

## PubSub function

You can deploy your functions written in any Kubeless supported runtimes to be triggerred by PubSub mechanism. The PubSub function is expected to consume input messages from a predefined topic from a messaging system. Kubeless currently supports using events from Kafka and NATS messaging systems as Triggers.

### Kafka

In Kubeless [release page](https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases), you can find the manifest to quickly deploy a collection of Kafka and Zookeeper statefulsets. If you have a Kafka cluster already running in the same Kubernetes environment, you can also deploy PubSub function with it. Check out [this tutorial](/docs/use-existing-kafka) for more details how to do that.

If you want to deploy the manifest we provide to deploy Kafka and Zookeeper execute the following command:

```console
$ kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/download/$RELEASE/kafka-zookeeper-$RELEASE.yaml
```

> NOTE: Kafka statefulset uses a PVC (persistent volume claim). Depending on the configuration of your cluster you may need to provision a PV (Persistent Volume) that matches the PVC or configure dynamic storage provisioning. Otherwise Kafka pod will fail to get scheduled. Also note that Kafka is only required for PubSub functions, you can still use http triggered functions. Please refer to [PV](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) documentation on how to provision storage for PVC.

Once deployed, you can verify two statefulsets up and running:

```
$ kubectl -n kubeless get statefulset
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
kafka     1         1         40s
zoo       1         1         42s

$ kubectl -n kubeless get svc
NAME        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
broker      ClusterIP   None            <none>        9092/TCP            1m
kafka       ClusterIP   10.55.250.89    <none>        9092/TCP            1m
zoo         ClusterIP   None            <none>        9092/TCP,3888/TCP   1m
zookeeper   ClusterIP   10.55.249.102   <none>        2181/TCP            1m
```

A function can be as simple as:

```python
def foobar(event, context):
  print event['data']
  return event['data']
```

Now you can deploy a pubsub function. 

```console
$ kubeless function deploy test --runtime python2.7 \
                                --handler test.foobar \
                                --from-file test.py
```

You need to create a _Kafka_ trigger that lets you associate a function with a topic specified by `--trigger-topic` as below:

```console
$ kubeless trigger kafka create test --function-selector created-by=kubeless,function=test --trigger-topic test-topic
```

After that you can invoke the function by publishing messages in that topic. To allow you to easily manage topics `kubeless` provides a convenience function `kubeless topic`. You can create/delete and publish to a topic easily.

```console
$ kubeless topic create test-topic
$ kubeless topic publish --topic test-topic --data "Hello World!"
```

You can check the result in the pod logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs test-695251588-cxwmc
...
Hello World!
```
### NATS

If you have an exisiting NATS cluster, if pretty to easy to get started.

Use the manifest to deploy Kubeless NATS triggers controller.

```console
kubectl create -f https://github.com/kubeless/kubeless/releases/download/$RELEASE/nats-$RELEASE.yaml
```

By default NATS trigger controller expects nats cluster is available as Kubernetes cluster service `nats.nats-io.svc.cluster.local:4222`. You can overide the default NATS cluster url used by setting the environment variable `NATS_URL` in the manifest. Once NATS trigger controller is setup you can deploy the function and associate function with a topic on the NATS cluster.

```console
$ kubeless function deploy pubsub-python-nats --runtime python2.7 \
                                --handler test.foobar \
                                --from-file test.py
```

After function is deployed you can use `kubeless trigger nats` CLI command to  associate function with a topic on NATS cluster as below.

```console
$ kubeless trigger nats create pubsub-python-nats --function-selector created-by=kubeless,function=pubsub-python-nats --trigger-topic test
```

If you do not have NATS cluster its pretty easy to setup a NATS cluster. Run below command to deploy a [NATS operator](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-operator)

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nats-io/nats-operator/master/example/deployment-rbac.yaml
```

Once NATS operator is up and running run below command to deploy a NATS cluster

```console
echo '
apiVersion: "nats.io/v1alpha2"
kind: "NatsCluster"
metadata:
  name: "nats"
spec:
  size: 3
  version: "1.1.0"
' | kubectl apply -f - -n nats-io
```

Above command will create NATS cluster IP service `nats.nats-io.svc.cluster.local:4222` which is the default URL Kubeless NATS trigger contoller expects.

At this point you are all set try Kubeless NATS triggers.

You could quickly test the functionality by publishing a message to the topic, and verifying that message is seen by the pod running the function.

```console
$ kubeless trigger nats publish --url nats://nats-server-ip:4222 --topic test --message "Hello World!"
```

You can check the result in the pod logs:

```console
$ kubectl logs pubsub-python-nats-5b9c849fc-tvq2l
...
Hello World!
```

## Other commands

You can delete and list functions:

```console
$ kubeless function ls
NAME        NAMESPACE   HANDLER     RUNTIME     DEPENDENCIES    STATUS
test        default     test.foobar python2.7                   1/1 READY

$ kubeless function delete test

$ kubeless function ls
NAME        NAMESPACE   HANDLER     RUNTIME     DEPENDENCIES    STATUS
```

You can create, list and delete PubSub topics:

```console
$ kubeless topic create another-topic
Created topic "another-topic".

$ kubeless topic delete another-topic

$ kubeless topic ls
```

You can also see the list of supported runtimes:

```console
$ kubeless get-server-config
INFO[0000] Current Server Config:
INFO[0000] Supported Runtimes are: python2.7, python3.4, python3.6, nodejs6, nodejs8, ruby2.4, php7.2
```
